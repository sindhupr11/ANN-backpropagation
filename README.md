# ANN-backpropagation

# Description:

This repository implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with backpropagation for predicting diabetes from the data. The code is divided into two Jupyter Notebooks:

preprocessing.ipynb: This notebook handles data preprocessing steps.

network.ipynb: This notebook defines the neural network architecture, including layers, activation functions, loss function, and optimizer. It also implements the backpropagation algorithm for training the network.
